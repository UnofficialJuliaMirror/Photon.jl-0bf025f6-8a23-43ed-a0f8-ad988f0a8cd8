# Photon

**Photon** is a developer friendly framework for Deep Learning in Julia. Under the hood
it leverages **Knet** and it provides a Keras like API on top of that.


## Steps
To train your own model, there are three steps to follow:

1) Create a model using the layers that come out of the box with Photon. 

2) Create a Workout that combines the model, a loss function and an optimizer.

3) Train the model by calling fit! on the workout and the training data



## Step 1: Model


## Step 2: Workout



## Step 3: fit!
