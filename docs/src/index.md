# Photon

**Photon** is a developer friendly framework for Deep Learning in Julia. Under the hood
it leverages **Knet** and it provides a Keras like API on top of that.

Photon is right now still very much alpha quality and the main goal of the current
version is to see what API's work best. So expect still to see some API changes
in the upcoming releases.
